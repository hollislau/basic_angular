# Basic Angular App
This is a simple Angular app that allows a user to modify or delete a default greeting displayed on the homepage.

To use this app, clone this repo to your local machine. Run `npm install`, then run `gulp` to compile the necessary files with Webpack. Start the server with `npm start`. In your browser, navigate to <http://localhost:5000> to play with the greeting. Modify the greeting by entering your own text in the provided input field, or remove it entirely by pressing the "Delete" button. Enjoy!
